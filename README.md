# Module 4 | Assignment - PyCitySchools

The objective of this challenge is to assist the school districts data manager Maria in in analyzing the 15 area high schools standardize test results and providing a summary of the findings.  

## School Summary
The school summary provides detail information about each school, including: 
- School Type / Total Student Count / Total School Budget / Per Student Budget / Average Math and Scores / Percentage of Students Passing

#Challenge

The first challege in this project was claning the data to ensure accuracy, this included addressing missing values and correcting student names by removing sufixes and prefixes. Once the data set was cleaned the math and reading averages were calculaed for each school, the passing grade was set as 70. In addition to test scores the schools size, each schools' budget and spending per capita was also measured. The overall passing average was clculated by dividing the number of stdents that passed both math and reading by the total number of students per school. individual calculations were made for Thomas highschool and it was found that the scores were much higher than originally recorded. The scores were corrected and tables were updated to reflect the new scores format was also applied throughout. 

Data shows that higher spending does not corelate to beter testing scores. Charter schools have better performance than the district and this could be atributed to smaller class size.there is no overall imrovement in either math or reading scores per school over time as the scores for each school from 9th to 12 grade remain about the same within less than a 2 percent deviation.The data provides a window into the districs performance. Good practices can be shared and dialog that could benefit the students in the future.
